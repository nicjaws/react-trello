## create-react-app

This project uses the popular [create-react-app (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) command to setup a modern React application. This way we can focus on the code itself, and not worry about configuring many build tools. 

The [package.json](https://github.com/AlterClassIO/react-trello/blob/master/package.json) file provides four scripts:

- `start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- `test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `eject`: Remove create-react-app build dependency from your project.
